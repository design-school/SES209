# Interview 

Interview is one of the most direct way to gather information about people’s life experiences, facts, desires, expectations, problems, needs, opinions and others. Interview is also really useful to get inspiration and being able to better understand the situation you want to work with. But take care, interview needs to be in a special mindset of LISTENING. 
Before your interview you have to carefully prepare your questions. Then you have to recruit participants and get their consent. Also before the interview is sure participants you are recruiting are people of your interest (for instance if you study use of mail on a smartphone, assure yourself they use smartphones). During the interview you should have, a device to record the conversation, and your sketchbook to take notes, and your interview script (list of questions).  While you are designing your questions as well as during the interview takes care to NOT TRY TO CONFIRM YOUR IDEAS, you should try to LISTEN AND UNDERSTAND what your participants are saying and thinking.

## Before running your interview you should read:
* Short video from by Google UX researchers (6 minutes): [How to ask a question?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tiuWYs5Z-A)
* Short video (2 minutes) about the value of interview for design: [The Value of Stakeholder Interviews — UX Design at Centreline Digital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfoRup4Ek5Y)
* Guide for interviewing : [Interview guides from human-centred design](SES209_01_Interview-guide-extract-HCD-IDEO.pdf)

## Supplies you need

* Phone with camera OR a real camera OR a sound recorder
* Pen, Pencil, Eraser
* Minitripod OR a tripod
* A microphone if you are in a noisy environment
* A sheet of paper to write your interview script.
* And a sheet of paper to take notes during the interview

## Steps

* 1 | (Do as a team:) Think who will be the meaningful peoples to interview? Which criteria(s) they have in common? And why? How can you contact and recruit these people and where can you find them? (You do not have to interview class mates.)
* 2 | (Do as a team:) Define the demographic questions of your interview (age, gender, education, activity ...) ?
* 3 | (Do as a team:) Define a set of questions about your object of interest, what you would like to learn? This set of questions should be ordered from the more specific to the more general. Try to have both open question and close question, order them from close to open. Also take care to frame the question as neutral as possible, do not frame the question with an expected answer. Please think of question that could help you to create a [journey map](). 
* 4 | (Make a Pilote.) Before interviewing people please try with a friend to test your questions and materials. If some do not work try to improve it, and then try again. It is rare to get the interview question OK from the first try. Try to agree on the question with your team members.
* 5 | (Do as a person:) Recruit people either by face-to-face conversation, email, phone, or other means. Try to avoid people you are close to. It is forbidden to use classmates for this exercise. 
* 6 | (Do as a person:) Choose the environment for doing the interview! If possible try to run the interview in the environment where the situation of your interest is happening. And if possible try to be in a confident quiet place. Sometime both are not possible.
* 7 | (Do as a person:) During the interview, when the person provides an interesting observation you can always ask questions about the motivation (why) internal or external, the way they do it (how), if they have an example. Motivation and practical approaches, and history of use are always really interesting to understand in a design context. Take notes during the interview, this will help you to remember some questions you can generate from the reply of the participants. 
* 8 | (Do as a person:) Always ask people at the end if they have any free comment they want to provide. 
* 9 | (Do as a person:) Write each questions into a google doc. For each questions write a small paragraphe about the interesting findings, and some quotes from the participant. Then write all thess informations into a Google doc. Name this google doc with the following name  "nom_prenom_interview_a2" and add it to the shared folder.
* 10 | (Do as a group:) Write each questions into a google doc. For each questions summerize the findings of the group (More interesting things). Then write all thess informations into a Google doc. Name this google doc with the following name  "group_interview_a2" and place it into your group folder on the shared google drive.
