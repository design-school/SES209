Interview is also really usefull to get inspiration and being able to better understand the situation you want to work with. But take care, interview need to be in a special mindset of LISTENING. 
Before your interview you have to carefully prepare your questions. Then you have to recruit participant and get their consent. Also before the interview be sure participant you are recruiting are people of your interest (for instance if you study use of mail on a smartphone, assure yourself they use smartphone). During the interview you should have, a device to record the conversation, and your sketchbook to take notes, and your interview script (list of question).  While you are designing your questions as well as during the interview take care to NOT TRY TO CONFIRM YOUR IDEAS, you should try to LISTEN AND UNDERSTAND what your participants are saying and thinking.
