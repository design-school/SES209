# Persona


User Journeys describe at a high level of detail exactly what steps different users take to complete a specific task within a system, application or website. This technique shows the current (as-is) user workflow, and reveals areas of improvement for the to-be workflow.

For this exercise we want a **draft** of a journey map. 
As draft is messy, sketchy and not finish, but try to make it the best as possible. 

Before this exercise it is better to have done the interview, the related work, and the personas.
