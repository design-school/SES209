## Patterns and advices: 

A pattern to build a short elevator pitch: 
* 1st sentence:  State the Problem or research question
* 2nd sentence:  State your solution or the experiment
* 3rd sentence:  Who you are, why you’re the one to solve the problem
* 4th sentence:  State the value proposition 
* 5th sentence:  Call to action (what the audience or recipient should do next)

You can change the order by moving 3 to 1 if you prefer. 
Don’t forget you do not have to follow the recipe, use it just if it’s help you to show some missing elements.  

At the end, the goal is to trigger a yes to a question like:  “Do I want another meeting with this person?"
