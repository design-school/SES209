# Related Work Exercises

Previous people in the world probably already meet similar problem(s) or the situation(s) than the one you are facing. And they probably have built some solutions for some good reasons. 
All designer is smarter when they know what has already been done before and for which criteria. So we want you to make a collection of **existing** solutions to the problem(s) or situation(s) you are facing and try to solve. This could be useful to generate more innovative solutions, new alternatives, or even improve the existing. So we want every one of you to find 10 solutions that already solve your problem in a way or in another. (If you have more it is OK too.)


## Supplies you need
* A computer 
* An Internet access


## Steps

* 0 |  Create a Google doc named "RelatedWork_a2" and create a "related work" folder inside your group folder in the Google drive.

* 1 | (To do as a group): discuss of the problem you are trying to solve and the situation you are facing. 

* 2 | Think about all the possible existing solutions that may solve your problem (partially or not) 

* 3 | Find a document (website, a picture, a research paper, newspaper, others) that discuss this solution and showcase it in a way or another. 

* 4 | Copy this link into the document "RelatedWork_a2" with the positive aspect of this solution on the next column same line, and the negative aspect of the solution on the third column same line. 

* 5 | Save the picture of the device into the "related work" folder of your group.

* 6 | Repeat the step 2,3,4,5 until you have 30 lines (each person of the group should bring 10 elements)

(If there is less than 30 solutions, then find some people discussing the problem, or maybe solution that are completely different but possible)
